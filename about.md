## *The Way of Mastery*

*The Way of Mastery* material is the result of a collaboration beginning
in 1987 between Jayem (Jon Marc Hammer) and Jeshua, also known as Jesus.
The five core texts that have resulted from this partnership are:

- [*The Jeshua Letters*](/wom/intro/tjl/)

    Jayem's account of his first meetings with Jeshua and the beautiful
    introduction to the pathway of awakening revealed in their
    conversation.

- [*The Way of the Servant*](/wom/intro/wos/)

    A poetic description of the journey of awakening taken from
    inception to recognition of self as the servant &ndash; one who walks this
    world awake.

- The core teaching &ndash; a compilation of a three year period of monthly messages.
    - [ Year One: *The Way of the Heart* ](/wom/intro/woh/)
    - [ Year Two: *The Way of Transformation* ](/wom/intro/wot/)
    - [ Year Three: *The Way of Knowing* ](/wom/intro/wok/)

Channeled sessions given by Jeshua prior to *The Way of the Heart*, called
[*The Early Years*](/wom/intro/early/), are available here as well.

[Q&A sessions](/wom/intro/questions/) occurring after a lesson are
included here and grouped together for easy reference.

Additionally, the original recording of each session is available along
side of transcript. Look for the <i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i> symbol.
