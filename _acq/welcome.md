## Joseph S. Benner
{: .disable-paragraph-marker}

Joseph Benner was born January 3, 1872 and passed away in 1941. He married in 1894 and had one daughter. He was a businessman much of his life.

He received messages from an inner Source throughout his lifetime and when he was in his mid-forties, he gave himself over entirely to be taught by that inner Presence.

In 1920 Benner’s teachings were studied by a group in Ohio called “The Sun Center.” Their practice was to have a noon time silence each day. He also wrote lessons entitled “The Inner Life Courses.”

His first book, “The Impersonal Life,” was published in 1914 which, along with his other books, was published anonymously. After his death his daughter continued to carry on his work and added his name as author.

This is a timeless book and has long been a classic in spiritual writing. “The author invites the reader to make the journey toward rediscovering the Self. He lays out the path one must tread toward the goal of inner development. He leads one on a well-defined, step-by-step way toward awakening. The great blessing of the Message is that, if you are ready, the I speaking herein will continue to speak direct to you from out your own heart—after you lay aside the book.” —from the book
