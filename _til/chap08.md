title: "The Word"

We will now take The Key and show you how the plan and process just
described is the one by which the world came into existence, how the
Earth and all that is in it and on it, including yourself and your
brothers and sisters, are but the outer manifestations on an Idea, My
Idea, which is now being thought into life expression.

I, the Creator, AM the Original THINKER, the One and Only THINKER.

First know that.

As previously stated, man does not think. It is I Who think through
his organism. Man believes he thinks, but before he has awakened to a
realization of Me within he only takes the thoughts I attract to or
inspire in his mind, and, mistaking their real meaning and purpose,
places a personal construction upon them and, through the selfish
desires thus aroused, creates for himself all his troubles and brings
upon himself all his woes.

These apparent mistakes, misconstructions and interferences of man are
in reality only the obstacles in his way to be overcome, that he may,
through the overcoming, finally develop a body and mind strong and
clean and capable enough to express perfectly and consciously this
Idea of Mine eternally working within his Soul.

Man, then, is only the organism I AM thus preparing through which to
manifest the perfection of My Idea. He provides the personality, with
its body, mind and intellect, through which I can express this Idea
perfectly, the physical brain with which I can think and speak It into
outer manifestation.

I plant in man's brain an Idea -- any idea. That idea would grow,
mature and speedily ripen into complete outer fruition or
manifestation, if man only would let it, would give his mind and
all its thoughts, his heart and all its desires wholly over to Me, and
let Me come forth as the perfect fulfillment of that Idea.

I will now plant in your brain-mind an Idea. May It grow, mature and
ripen into the glorious harvest of Wisdom which is awaiting you, if
you let Me direct Its growth and expression through you.

In one of My other Revelations, called the Bible, you are told much
about &ldquo;The Word&rdquo; but very few, even the most learned Bible students,
comprehend My meaning.

You are told that:

&ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.

The same was in the beginning with God.

All things were made by him, by the Word, and without Him -- the
Word -- was not anything made that was made.&rdquo;

You shall learn herein how My Word was in the beginning, how It was with
Me, and how It was I, My Self; how all things were made by Me and by My
Word, and that without Me and My Word was nothing made that now exists.

Now, a word to the human understanding is a symbol of an Idea; that
is, it stands for, embodies, and represents an Idea.

You are a Word, a symbol of an Idea, if you can see it. So is a
diamond, a violet, a horse.

When you can discern the idea back of the symbol, then you know the
soul or the reality of the manifestation appearing as a man, a
diamond, a horse, a violet.

Hence, a word, as used in the above quotation, means an Idea, an Idea
latent and unmanifest, however, waiting to be expressed, or thought
and spoken forth, in some form or another.

The Word that was in the beginning and that was with Me was then not
only an Idea, but It was My Idea of My Self IN EXPRESSION in a new
state or condition, which you call Earth life.

This Idea was I, My Self, because It was part of Me, being as yet
latent and unmanifest within Me; for It was of the substance and
essence of My BE-ing, which is Itself an Idea, the One Original Idea.

All things were made by Me by the vitalized action of this, My Idea,
being thought and spoken into expression; and nothing has been or ever
can be expressed in Earth life without having My Idea as the primary
and fundamental cause and principle of its being.

This, My Idea, therefore, is now in the process of unfoldment or of
being thought into outer expression -- some call it evolution -- just as
is the flower when the bud puts forth from the stalk and finally opens
into the blossom, obeying the urge to express My Idea hidden within its
soul.

Just so will I develop and unfold all My mediums of expression, which
shall finally, unitedly and completely picture forth My Idea from out
their souls, in all the glory of Its perfection.

At present these mediums are of such nature that they require many
languages of many types, from the simplest to the most complex,
composed of almost an infinite number of Words, to express My Idea.

But when I shall have completely thought out My Idea, or shall have
perfected My many mediums of expression, then shall My Idea shine
forth in every Word, each, in fact, being a perfect part or phase of
My Idea, all so chosen and arranged that they will really be as one
Word, radiating the sublime significance of My Meaning.

Then shall all languages have melted, merged, into one language, and
all words into One Word; for all mediums shall have become One flesh,
the now perfected medium for the complete expression in One Word of My
Idea, -- My SELF.

Then shall My SELF, now capable of being expressed by these perfected
Words, shine through Its medium of expression, -- through the
personalities, their bodies, minds and intellects; and the Word shall
have become flesh, or shall BE the flesh.

This means that all Words, through the regenerative power of My Idea
within, shall have evolved through the flesh, transmuting and
spiritualizing it and making it so transparent and pure that the
personality will have nothing more of Earth nature left in it to hinder
Impersonal expression, enabling My SELF, therefore, to shine forth
perfectly and become fully manifest; thus amalgamating once more all
Words and all flesh into One Word, THE WORD, which was in the beginning,
and which then will shine through all created flesh as the SUN OF GLORY,
-- The CHRIST of GOD!

This is the plan and purpose of My Creation and of all manifested
things.

A glimpse of the process of My Creation, or of My Thinking My Idea of
My Self into Earth expression, will be given in what follows.
