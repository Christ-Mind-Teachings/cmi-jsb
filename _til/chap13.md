title: "Soul Mates"

Let us now examine into some of the things I have given you, those
especially of which you cannot yet acknowledge Me as the Giver.

Perhaps the particular position in life you now occupy you do not
think the best adapted for the expression of My Idea surging within
you.

If so, then why not step out of that position into the one of your
choice?

The mere fact that you cannot or do not do this proves that at this
time such position is the one best suited to awaken in you certain
qualities necessary for My perfect expression, and that I, your own
Self, AM permitting you to remain therein, until you can recognize my
Purpose and Meaning hidden within the power such position has to
disturb your peace of mind and keep you thus dissatisfied.

When you recognize My Meaning and determine to make My Purpose your
purpose, then and then only will I give you the strength to step out
of that position into a higher I have provided for you.

Perhaps the husband or the wife you have, you think is far from being
suited to you or capable of helping along your &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; awakening,
being only a hindrance and detriment, instead. You may even be
secretly contemplating leaving or wishing you could leave that one for
another who sympathizes and joins with you in your aspirations and
seeking, and therefore seems more nearly your ideal.

You may run away if you will, but know that you cannot run away from
your own personality; that, in selfish craving for a "spiritual" mate
you may attract only one who will force you to a tenfold longer and
harder search among the illusions of the mind, before you can again
awaken to the consciousness of My Voice speaking within.

For a sympathetic and appreciative mate would only feed the personal
pride and selfish desire for &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; power in you, and develop
further the egotistic side of your nature. Likewise, a loving, trusting,
yielding mate might encourage only selfishness and conceit, when you are
not yet abiding in the consciousness of My Impersonal Love; while a
tyrannical, suspicious, nagging mate may provide the soul discipline you
still need.

Did you but know it, the one who is your true Soul mate is in reality an
Angel from Heaven, even as are You, one of the Attributes of My Divine
Self, come to you to teach you that only when you have purged your own
personality so that My Holy Love can express, can you be freed from any
conditions which may now be causing you so much disturbance of mind and
unhappiness of Soul.

For not until this Soul, this Angel from Heaven, this other part of My
and Your Self, who has come to you and is yearning and striving to
call into expression through you the Impersonal Love, the tender,
thoughtful care for others, the poise of mind and peace of heart, the
quiet, firm mastery of self, which and which alone can open the doors,
so It can step forth into the freedom of Its own glorious Being and be
to You Its own true Self, not until you can see this Soul in all
Its Divine beauty, free of this Earthly bondage, will it ever be
possible for you to find and recognize that Ideal you seek.

For that Ideal exists, not without &ndash; in some other personality, but
only within, in your Divine Counterpart, which is I, your Higher,
Immortal Self. It is only My Idea of this, your Perfect Self, striving
to express and become manifest through your personality, that causes you
to see seeming imperfections in the mate I have given you.

The time will come, however, when you cease to look without for love
and sympathy, appreciation and spiritual help, and turn wholly to Me
within, that these seeming imperfections will disappear; and you will
see in this mate only the reflection of qualities of unselfish love,
gentleness, trust, a constant endeavor to make the other happy, that
will then be shining brightly and continuously from out your own
heart.

Perhaps you cannot yet wholly believe all this, and you still question
that I, your own Self, am responsible for your present position in
life, or that I chose for you your present mate?

If so, it is well for you thus to question until all is made plain.

But remember, I will speak much more clearly direct from within, if
you but turn trustingly to Me for help. For I ever preserve My Holiest
secrets for those who turn to Me in deep, abiding Faith that I can and
will supply their every need.

To you, however, who cannot yet do this, I say, if your own Self did
not place you here or provide this mate, Why then are you here? And
Why have you this mate?

Think!

I, the ALL, the Perfect One, make no mistake.

Yes, but the personality does, you say. And the personality chose this
mate, and perhaps has earned no better position.

What, who, caused the personality to choose this particular one and earn
this particular position in life? Who picked out and placed this one
where you could thus choose, and who caused you to be born in this
country of all countries and in this town of all towns in the world at
this particular time? Why not some other town and a hundred years later?
Did your personality do all these things?

Answer truly and satisfactorily these questions to yourself, and you
will learn that I God, within you, your own Self, do all things that
you do, and I do them well.

I do them while expressing My Idea, Which is ever seeking
manifestation in outer form as Perfection through you, My living
Attribute, even as it is in the Eternal, within.

As for your true &ldquo;Soul Mate,&rdquo; which you have been led by others to
believe must be waiting for you somewhere, cease looking; for it
exists not without in some other body, but within your own Soul.

For that within you which cries out for completion is only your sense
of Me within, yearning for recognition and expression; Me, your own
Divine Counterpart, the Spiritual part of you, your other half, to
which and which alone you must be united, before you can finish what
you came on Earth to express.

This is indeed a mystery to you who are not yet wedded in
consciousness to your Impersonal Self; but doubt not, when you can
come to Me in complete surrender, and will care for naught else than
union with Me, then will I disclose to you the sweets of the Celestial
Ecstasy I have long kept in reserve for you.
