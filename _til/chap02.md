title: "Be Still! and KNOW I AM God"
---

Now, in order that you may learn to know Me, so that you can be sure
it is I, your own True Self, Who speak these words, you must first
learn to Be Still, to quiet your human mind and body and all their
activities, so that you no longer are conscious of them.

You may not yet be able to do this, but I will teach you how, if you
really want to know Me, and are willing to prove it by trusting Me and
obeying Me in all that I now shall call upon you to do.

Listen!

Try to imagine the "I" who speaks throughout these pages as being your
Higher or Divine Self, addressing and counseling your human mind and
intellect, which you will consider for the moment as being a separate
personality. Your human mind is so constituted that it cannot accept
anything which does not conform with what it has previously
experienced or learned, and which its intellect does not consider
reasonable. Therefore, in addressing it, You are using such terms and
expressions as will most clearly explain to your intellect the truths
it must understand before the mind can awaken to the consciousness of
your meaning.

The fact is, this "I" is yourself, your Real Self. Your human mind has
heretofore been so engrossed with the task of supplying its intellect
and body with all manner of selfish indulgences, that it has never had
time to get acquainted with the Real You, its true Lord and Master. You
have been so interested in and affected by the pleasures and sufferings
of your body and intellect, that you have almost come to believe You are
your intellect and body, and you have consequently nearly forgotten Me,
your Divine Self.

I AM not your intellect and body, and this Message is to teach that
You and I are One. The words I herein speak, and the main burden of
these instructions, is to awaken your consciousness to this great
fact.

You cannot awaken to this fact until you can get away from the
consciousness of this body and intellect, which so long have held you
enslaved. You must feel Me within, before you can know I AM there.

Now, in order that you can become wholly oblivious of your mind and
its thoughts and your body and its sensations, so that you can feel Me
within, it is necessary that you studiously obey these, My
instructions.

Sit quietly in a relaxed position, and, when wholly at ease, let your
mind take in the significance of these words:

"Be still! --- and KNOW --- I AM --- God."

Without thinking, allow this, My Divine Command, to penetrate deep into
your Soul. Let whatever impressions that come to your mind enter at will
without effort or interference on your part. Note carefully their
import, for it is I, within, through these impressions, instructing you.
Then, when somewhat of their vital significance begins to dawn upon your
consciousness, speak these My Words slowly, imperatively, to every cell
of your body, to every faculty of your mind, with all the conscious
power you possess:

"Be still! --- and KNOW --- I AM --- God."

Speak them just as they are herein written, trying to realize that the
God of you commands and demands of your mortal self: implicit
obedience.

Study them, search out their hidden potency.

Brood over them, carry them with you into your work, whatever it be.
Make them the vital, dominating factor in your work, in all your
creative thoughts.

Say them a thousand times a day,

Until you have discovered all My innermost meaning;

Until every cell of your body thrills in joyful response to the
command, &ldquo;Be Still,&rdquo; and instantly obeys;

And every vagrant thought hovering around your mind hies itself off
into nothingness.

Then, as the Words reverberate through the caverns of your now, empty
being;

Then, as the Sun of Know-ing begins to rise on the horizon of your
consciousness;

Then, will you feel the swell of a wondrous strange Breath filling you
to the extreme of all your mortal members, causing your senses almost
to burst with the ecstasy of it; then, will there come surge after
surge of a mighty, resistless Power rising within you, lifting you
almost off the Earth; then, will you feel within the Glory, the
Holiness, the Majesty of My Presence;

And then, then you will KNOW, I AM, God.

You, when you have felt Me thus in such moments within, when you have
tasted of My Power, hearkened to My Wisdom, and know the ecstasy of My
all-embracing Love, no disease can touch, no circumstance can weaken,
no enemy can conquer you. For now you KNOW I AM within, and you always
hereafter will turn to Me in your need, putting all your trust in Me,
and allowing Me to manifest My Will.

You, when you turn thus to Me, will always find Me an unfailing and
ever present help in time of need; for I will so fill you with a
Realization of My Presence and of My Power, that you need only Be
Still and allow Me to do whatever you want done -- heal your ills and
those of others, illumine your mind so you can see with My eyes the
Truth you seek, or perform perfectly the tasks which before seemed
almost impossible of accomplishment.

This Knowledge, this Realization, will not come at once. It may not
come for years. It may come tomorrow.

It depends upon no one but You;

Not upon your personality, with its human desires and human
understanding;

But upon the I AM of you &ndash; God, within.

Who is it that causes the bud to open into the blossom?

Who causes the chick to burst its shell?

Who decides the day and the hour?

It is the conscious, natural act of the Intelligence within, My
Intelligence, directed by My Will, bringing to fruition My Idea and
expressing it in the blossom and in the chick.

But did the blossom and the chick have anything to do with it?

No, only as they submitted or united their will with Mine and allowed
Me and My Wisdom to determine the hour and the ripeness for action,
and then only as they obeyed the impulse of My Will to make the
effort, could they step forth into the New Life.

You may, with your personality, try a thousand times a thousand times
to burst through the shell of your human consciousness.

It will result only, if at all, in a breaking down of the doors I have
provided between the world of tangible forms and the real of
intangible dreams; and the door being open, you then no longer can
keep out intruders from your private domain, without much trouble and
suffering.

But even through such suffering you may gain the strength you lack and
the wisdom needed to know that, not until you yield up all desire for
knowledge, for goodness, yes, for union with Me, to benefit self, can
you unfold your petals showing forth the perfect Beauty of My Divine
Nature, and throw off the shell of your human personality and step forth
into the glorious Light of My Heavenly Kingdom.

Therefore I give you these directions now, at the beginning, that you
may be learning how to recognize Me.

For I here promise you, if you follow and strive earnestly to
comprehend and obey My instructions herein given, you shall very soon
know Me, and I will give you to comprehend all of My Word wherever
written, -- in book or teaching, in Nature, or in your fellow man.

If there is much in what herein is written that seems contradictory,
seek out My real meaning before discarding it.

Do not leave a single paragraph, or any one thought in it, until all
that is suggested becomes clear.

But in all your seeking and all your striving, let it be with faith
and trust in Me, your True Self within, and without being anxious
about results; for the results are all in My keeping, and I will take
care of them. Your doubts and your anxiety are but of the personality,
and if allowed to persist will lead only to failure and
disappointment.
