title: I AM
---

To you who read, I speak.

To you, who, through long years and much running to and fro, have been
eagerly seeking, in books and teachings, in philosophy and religion,
for you know not what &mdash; Truth, Happiness, Freedom, God;

To you whose Soul is weary and discouraged and almost destitute of
hope;

To you, who many times have obtained a glimpse of that &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; only to
find, when you followed and tried to reach it, that it disappeared in
the beyond, and was but the mirage of the desert;

To you, who thought you had found it in some great teacher, who was
perhaps the acknowledged head of some Society, Fraternity or Religion,
and who appeared to you to be a &ldquo;Master&rdquo;, so marvelous was the wisdom he
taught and the works he performed; only to awaken later to the
realization that that &ldquo;Master&rdquo; was but a human personality, with faults
and weaknesses, and secret sins, the same as you, even though that
personality may have been a channel through which were voiced many
beautiful teachings, which seemed to you the highest &ldquo;Truth;&rdquo;

And here you are, Soul aweary and enhungered, and not knowing where to
turn.

To you, I AM come.

Likewise to you, who have begun to feel the presence of that &ldquo;Truth&rdquo;
within your Soul, and seek the confirmation of that which of late has
been vaguely struggling for living expression within;

Yes, to all you who hunger for the true &ldquo;Bread of Life,&rdquo; I AM come.

Are you ready to partake?

If so, then arouse yourself. Sit up. Still your human mind and follow
closely My Word herein spoken. Or you will turn away disappointed once
more, with the aching hunger still in your heart.

I!

Who am I?

I, Who speak with such seeming knowledge and authority?

Listen!

I AM You, that part of you who IS and KNOWS;

WHO KNOWS ALL THINGS,

And always knew, and always was.

Yes, I AM You, Your SELF; that part of you who says I AM and is I AM;

That transcendent, innermost part of you which quickens within as you
read, which responds to this My Word, which perceives Its Truth, which
recognizes all Truth and discards all error wherever found. Not that
part which has been feeding on error all these years.

For I AM your real Teacher, the only real one you will ever know, and
the only MASTER;

I, your Divine SELF.

I, the I AM of you, bring to you this My Message, My living Word, as I
have brought to you everything in life, be it book or &ldquo;Master&rdquo; to teach
you that I and I alone, your own True Self, AM The Teacher for you, the
only Teacher and the only God, Who is and always has been providing you
not only with the Bread and Wine of Life, but with all things needed for
your physical, mental and spiritual growth and sustenance.

Therefore that which appeals to YOU, as you read, is MY Message, spoken
to your outer human consciousness from within, and is but a confirmation
of that which the I AM of you always knew within, but had not yet
translated in definite, tangible terms to your outer consciousness.

Likewise, all that ever appealed to You, coming from some outward
expression, was but the confirmation of My Word already spoken within.
The outward expression was the avenue or means I chose at the time
through which to reach and impress your human or self consciousness.

I AM not your human mind, nor its child, the intellect. They are but
the expression of your Being, as you are the expression of My Being;
they are but phases of your human personality, as You are a phase of
My Divine Impersonality.

Weigh and study carefully these words.

Rise up and free yourself now and for always from the domination of
your personality, with its self-inflated and self-glorifying mind and
intellect.

For your mind henceforth must be Your servant, and the intellect Your
slave, if My Word is to penetrate to your Soul consciousness.

I AM come now to your Soul consciousness, which I have quickened
expressly in preparation for the reception of My Word.

Now, if you are strong enough to bear it;

If you can put aside all your private personal fancies, beliefs and
opinions, which are but the rubbish you have gathered from the dumping
grounds of others;

If you are strong enough to cast them all away;

Then My Word will be to you a source of endless Joy and Blessing.

Be prepared to have this personality of yours doubt My Word as you
read It all along the way;

For its very life is threatened, and it knows it cannot live and thrive
and longer dominate your thinking, your feelings, your going and coming,
as of old, if you take My Word into your heart and permit It there to
abide.

Yes, I AM come to you now,

To make you conscious of My Presence;

For I have likewise prepared your human mind so that it can, in a
measure, comprehend the meaning of Me.

I have been with you always, but you did not know it.

I have purposely led you through the Wilderness of books and teaching,
of religions and philosophies, keeping ever before your Soul's eye the
vision of the Promised Land; feeding you with the manna of the Desert,
that you might remember and value and long for the Bread of the
Spirit.

Now I have brought you to the river Jordan that separates you from
your Divine heritage.

Now the time has come for you consciously to know Me; the time has come
for you to cross over into Canaan, the land of Milk and Honey.

Are you ready?

Do you want to go?

Then follow this My Word, which is the Ark of My Covenant, and you
shall go over dry shod.
