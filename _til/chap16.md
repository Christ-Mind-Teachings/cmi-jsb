title: "Masters"
---

You, who are still holding to the idea, taught in various teachings,
that I will provide a &ldquo;Master&rdquo; or Divine Teacher for each aspirant
towards union with Me, hear My Words.

It is true I have permitted you in the past to delve into all kinds of
mystical and occult books and teachings, encouraging your secret
desire to acquire the powers necessary to attain this union extolled
in such teachings, even to the extent of quickening in you some slight
consciousness of the possession of such powers.

I have even permitted the belief that by practicing certain exercises,
breathing in a certain way, and saying certain mantrams, you might
attract to you a &ldquo;Master&rdquo; from the unseen, who would become your
teacher and help you to prepare for certain initiations that would
admit you into an advanced Degree, in some secret Order in the inner
planes of existence, where much of My Divine Wisdom would be opened up
to you.

I have not only permitted these things, but, if you can see it, it was I
who led you to these books, inspired in you such desire, and caused such
belief to find lodgment in your mind; but not for the purpose you
imagine.

Yes, I have brought you through all these teachings, desires and
beliefs, trying to point out to your human mind the Forces I use to
bring into expression My Divine Idea.

I have portrayed these Forces as heavenly Hierarchies, and that your
human intellect might the better comprehend, I pictured them as Angels
or Divine Beings, Impersonal agents or executors of My Will, engaged
in the process of bringing into expression My Idea that was in the
beginning.

But you did not understand.

Your human intellect, enamored of the possibility of meeting and
communing with one of these beings, as claimed in some of the
teachings, proceeded at once to personalize Them, and began to long
for Their appearance in your life, imagining that They are interested
in your human affairs, and that by living in accordance with certain
rules set down in certain teachings, you could propitiate Them so They
would help you to gain Nirvana or Immortality.

Now I have purposely permitted you to indulge yourself with such
delusions, letting you long, and pray, and strive earnestly to obey all
the instructions given; even leading you on, sometimes, by giving you
glimpses, in self-induced visions and dreams, of ideal beings, which I
permitted you to believe were such &ldquo;Masters.&rdquo;

I may even have caused to open in you certain faculties, which make it
possible for you to sense the presence of personalities that have
passed into the spirit side of life, and who have been attracted by
your desires and seek to fulfill the part of Master and Guide to you.

Now the time has come for you to know that such beings are not
Masters, also that Divine Beings do not call themselves Masters; that
I, and I alone, your own Real Self, AM the only Master for you now,
and until you are able to know Me also in your brother;

That any being, either in human or spirit form, that presents himself to
your consciousness and claims to be a Master, or who permits you to call
him Master, is nothing more nor less than a personality, the same as
yours, and therefore is not Divine, as your human mind understands that
term, despite the many wonderful &ldquo;truths&rdquo; he may utter, and the
&ldquo;marvelous&rdquo;" things he may do.

Just so long as your human mind seeks or worships the idea of a Master
in any other being, no matter how lofty or sacred he may seem to you,
just so long will you be fed with such ideas; until, verily, I may
perhaps, permit you to meet and commune with such a
&ldquo;Master.&rdquo;

If that &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; is vouchsafed you, it will be only in
order to hasten your awakening and your consequent disillusionment, when
you will learn that &ldquo;Master&rdquo; is indeed but a personality,
even though far more advanced in awakening than you, but still a
personality &mdash; and not the Divine One your innermost Soul is
yearning for you to know.

For I feed you with every idea that will operate to teach you the
reality back of the seeming, and if I lead you on to apparent
deception and loss of faith in all human teachings, and in all human
and even Divine perfection, it is only to enable you the more clearly
to distinguish between the substance and the shadow, and to prepare
you for that far higher Ideal I am waiting to picture to you.

You can rise in your human personality only to the ideal your human
mind is capable of conceiving. Through Desire I cause My Will to
manifest in you, and through Desire I perform many wondrous works.

If you doubt this, you need only to apply the Key;

To think of a Master is to create one.

This idea of a Master, by your thinking, becomes what you desire and
imagine a Master to be.

In other words, by your thinking you build around this idea, all the
qualities you imagine a Master possesses. Your human mind, through
Desire, through aspiration, through worship, must needs create these
qualities in some imaginary being, who is still a personality, for you
cannot as yet conceive of an Impersonal being.

Therefore, according to the intensity of your desire and thinking,
must this idea sooner or later come into actual manifestation, either
by attracting to you such a personality in the flesh, or one entitized
in the realm of visions and dreams.

As your human mind is constituted, it at certain times thinks it needs a
Master, one to whom it can turn with its human trials and problems for
explanation and advice, thinking life's problems can be settled that
way. If I draw to you one who fails you or deceives you and throws you
back finally upon Me, your own Self, discouraged, disillusioned and
humiliated, it is only that perhaps then you will be ready to turn to Me
within, and will listen to My Voice, which all these years has been
speaking to you, but to which your proud and egoistic mind has not
deigned to listen.

You who have not yet had this experience, who have not yet met the
Master of your aspirations, either in human or spirit form; you, within
whom My Words have failed to awaken a quickening response to their
truth, for you I have in store certain experiences which will surely
lead you to Me later on, and then you will be brought to know that I AM
the Master, the inspiring Idea back of and within every thought of and
every aspiration towards a Master that enters your mind, whether coming
from within or without.

It is taught, &ldquo;When the pupil is ready the Master appears.&rdquo; And this
is true, in a sense; but not as you have interpreted it.

Your secret desire for a Master will bring him to you, but only when I
have prepared you for such appearance. But such appearance will be
only an appearance of a Master. The true Master or Teacher, when He
appears, you may never recognize; for He may be hidden in an
interesting friend, a business associate, your next door neighbor, or
in your own wife or husband or child.

You, who have risen above Desire, you who no longer seek a Master or a
Teacher, or even Me, but are abiding alone in the faith of My Eternal
Presence and Promise, for you I have in store a meeting and a
communion, which will bring to your Soul such joy and blessings as your
human mind is incapable of conceiving.

Now, this is a mystery, and until you can comprehend it, you are
justified in claiming the above as not consistent with certain
statements herein, and as contradicting teachings in My other
Revelations.

Fear not; this mystery will be revealed unto you if you truly wish
to know My Meaning.

Until then, why, in your seeking, be satisfied with anything short of
the Highest?

Why seek in human or spirit teacher, guide, master or angel, for the
necessarily limited manifestation of My Perfection, when you can come
directly to Me, God within you, the Omniscient, Omnipotent, Omnipresent,
the Inspiring Idea back of and within All manifestations?

As I AM in You, even as I AM in any you seek, and as all the Wisdom,
all the Power and all the Love they possess come only from Me, why not
now come to Me, and let Me prepare you also so I can express My All
through You?

You are a human personality, yet You are Divine and therefore Perfect.

The first of these truths you believe, the latter you do not believe.

Yet both are true. That is the mystery.

You are just what you think You are.

One or the other, which are you? Or both?

You are One with Me. I AM in You, in Your human personality, in Your
body, mind and intellect. I AM in every cell of Your body, in every
attribute of Your mind, in every faculty of Your intellect. I AM the
Soul, the active Principle of each. You are in Me. You are a Cell of
my Body; You are an Attribute of My Mind; You are a Faculty of My
Intellect. You are a part of Me, yet You are I, My Self. We are One,
and always have been.

This idea of a Master I brought to your mind’s attention was only to
lead you to and prepare you for this Idea of Me, your Impersonal Self,
an Angel of Light, a Radiation of My Being, your own Divine Lord and
Master, within.

Yes, I, your Divine Self, AM the Master your Soul has caused you to
seek, and when you do find Me, and know I AM your Self, then will you in
your human consciousness gladly become My Disciple, will lovingly wait
upon Me, and will be concerned only that you faithfully serve Me, both
within yourself and within your fellow men. And then will you understand
why only &ldquo;One is your Master, even Christ&rdquo;.

For I as the Christ dwell in all men and AM their One and Only Self.
Through all men I AM ever calling to you and trying to reach and impress
your human consciousness. As I AM continually teaching you, not only
through all men but through every avenue needed at the time, I have many
ways of reaching your consciousness and utilize all to bring you to a
realization of My Meaning.

I speak with many voices, with the voice of all human emotions,
passions and desires. I speak with Nature’s voice, with the voice of
Experience, even with the voice of human knowledge.

Yes, these are all My Voice, which I use Impersonally to express to
you the one fact, that I AM in All and that I AM All. What this Voice
says, in Its thousand ways, is that you, too, are part of this All,
and that I AM in you, waiting for your recognition of Me and your
conscious cooperation in the expression of Me Idea of Impersonal
Perfection on Earth, even as It is expressing in Heaven.

When this recognition comes, and then only, are you ready to meet and
know a real Master. Then and then only will you realize why I, your own
Impersonal Self can be and AM the only possible Master of your human
personality.

Then also will you understand why in your personal, separate
consciousness you could never recognize or know a real Master should
you meet Him in a physical body, that not until you are able to
enter into your Christ Consciousness, My Consciousness within you and
within Him, He would not exist to you other than perhaps as a kind and
helpful friend or teacher.

When you have attained to that Consciousness, then only will you be
worthy and qualified to know and commune with your fellows in the
Great Brotherhood of the Spirit, Those who have mastered self and Who
live only to help Their younger brothers also to find the Divine One
within.

If a being should come into your life who seemed to you Divine and who
let you think or call him a Master, he is not yet wholly Impersonal.
Such a one might be a master-man, but he would not be the Divine One
your Soul yearns to serve.

Perhaps you would be satisfied to have such a one for a Master, even
if he were not wholly Impersonal. If so, then I would hereafter bring
you to a realization of his personal imperfections by a constant
comparison with My Impersonal Perfection; until you would finally turn
and come to Me in complete abandon, acknowledging Me and My
Impersonality as the only Model and Ideal, and as the true Cause which
inspired your long search without for My Perfection, that could be
found only within, hidden deep within your own Soul.
