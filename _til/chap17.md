title: "The Christ and Love"
---

To you who fear that My Words may destroy your belief in and love for
the Lord Jesus Christ, I say:

Two thousand years ago, when the process of the expression of My Idea
had reached the stage where I could show forth some of My Divine
Reality, in order to do this and to recall to My human Attributes
their mission on Earth, it became necessary to express through a human
personality and to manifest in a human form My Divine Attributes, so
their human minds and intellects could see and remember and be
inspired by Me within to let My Idea similarly express through and
manifest in their human personalities.

This I did through the personality of Jesus, the man of Galilee,
picturing to the human understanding by My Teachings given through
Him, and by My Life manifested by Him, what was necessary in order to
express fully My Divine Idea.

I showed, by the experiences of a symbolic nature through which I caused
His human personality I created for such purpose to pass, what all
personalities must pass through before you, My human Attributes, who
created these personalities, can again become Impersonal enough to be
conscious expressors with Me of My Divine Idea.

All of you, My human Attributes, before the I AM within can awaken your
human minds to a realization of Me, your Divine Self must be born of a
Virgin Love in a humble manger -- the place where the cattle come to
feed (the humble and contrite heart filled with faith and trust in God,
to which state the human or animal nature must come). You must then be
taken into Egypt, the land of darkness (or intellectual activity), there
to grow and thrive in body and understanding until you become strong
with the feeling of Me within. Then, when you are sufficiently conscious
of My Power and My Love, will I begin to speak through you words of
Wisdom and Truth, which will confound the learned of the world, even the
Doctors of the Law. Then will follow a long period of study and
meditation, which ripens the mind and develops the Soul, until you
arrive at full maturity of the I AM Consciousness within, and which
prepare you for your baptism in the Jordan, when you will be opened
completely to Me, to the full consciousness that You and I are One, that
there is no separation, that I AM your Real Self; and I AM henceforth
permitted wholly to direct your lives.

I then lead you out into the world, called in My other Revelation the
Wilderness, there to try you and make you strong and to accustom you to
the Impersonal use of My Divine Attributes I bring to you three great
Temptations of Power, Self-Righteousness, and Money, until you have
proven that nothing of the intellect, nothing of the self, nothing from
without, can tempt you to forget Me within, and that My Voice and Mine
alone, whether speaking in your heart or in the hearts of your brothers,
is the only Voice you are now capable of hearing.

This proven, there will begin the period of performing miracles and of
teaching the multitude, accompanied by the revilement and persecution
of the unbelieving and scoffing world; followed by the trial before
Pontius Pilate, the representative of the Worldly Law; the sentence;
the ascent of Calvary carrying the Cross; the being nailed upon the
Cross; the Agony; the three days in the tomb; and then the final
resurrection, when you enter into complete union with Me.

All of which has its inner meaning, or Soul application, and which
should be readily understood by you, if you have opened your heart to
Me.

Such has been The Way in the past for you and for all who have studied
and followed My Teachings, given forth in My former Revelations. Now the
time has come when I have prepared you and many for a new Dispensation,
wherein you can enter into the consciousness of Me direct and at once by
the Impersonal Way. Those who are big enough and strong enough to throw
off all claims of the human personality, and who can say I AM, and know
I AM The ONE within Who gives them this strength and enables them to
rise above the attractions and influences of the outer world, -- those
are the ones I have chosen through whom to express all the wondrous
glories of My Divine Idea.

The Christ, or the I AM Consciousness, must be born in your heart and
in the heart of every human personality, must grow and thrive and pass
through in some manner every experience symbolized in the life of
Jesus, before you can come to this point and become a conscious
expressor with Me of My Divine Idea. The example of the Christ Love
and Compassion which I expressed in that Life must you also express in
some degree in your life, before you can taste of the fruits of that
Love, which in reality is not love, but the Holy Three-in-One,
Love-Wisdom-Power, that is the true expression of My Impersonal Life.

You heretofore have not known the meaning of the Impersonal Life, hence
you could not know the meaning of Impersonal Love. Love to you, if you
will carefully analyze that feeling, has always been a human emotion or
expression; and you have been unable to conceive of a love devoid of or
unattached to some human or personal interest. Now, as you begin to feel
Me within your heart and open it wide to contain Me, will I fill you
with a wondrous strange new feeling, which will quicken every fibre of
your being with the creative instinct, and be to you a veritable Elixir
of Life. For in the outer expression of that feeling, when I thus,
through you, pour it forth into the world, will you taste of the
unutterable sweetness of My Holy Impersonal Love, with Its accompanying
illumination of mind and consciousness of unlimited Power; and It will
make you a wholly selfless and therefore perfect channel for the
Impersonal expression of My Divine Idea.

You will then realize that you are part of Me and part of every other
being, and that all you have or are, is not yours, but Mine, for Use
wherever and however I direct.

Your life will no longer be centered in your self, but that self will be
lost, merged in your other Selves, giving freely of your Life, your
Understanding, your Strength, your Substance, which are but phases of My
Impersonal Life or My Impersonal Love, that I have portioned out to you
only for such use.

In the personality of Jesus, the Christ, I manifested much of the Love
Impersonal, enough to inspire and lead you into seeking to emulate His
Life and His Personality, and, through such seeking and striving, to
awaken in you the Consciousness of the Christ within you. Through this
awakening and the realization that the Christ is but the channel or
door that opens unto Me, I have finally brought you to the point where
you can enter in and consciously become a part of My Impersonal Life.

I here tell you plainly that My Impersonal Love has naught to do with
personal lives and personal loves. All such are but the outer mediums
I use through which to pour from out the heart of Humanity into the
world My Real Love, where it is ever expressing its all-embracing,
vitalizing, creative, and uplifting Power.

My Love considers not individuals or personalities; they are but pawns
on the chess-board of life which I move as I deem best to accomplish My
purpose, the full and complete expression in Humanity of My Divine
Idea.

In Humanity only can I express My Idea, even as you can express your
idea of yourself only in and through your human personality.

In Humanity I live and move and have My Being. It is the mortal
personality and body of My Immortal Self, even as your personality and
its body is what you use to express your being.

All individual human personalities with their bodies are but the cells
of My Body of Humanity. Just as the I AM of you is now building your
body so that through it You can perfectly express My Idea of you, or
your Real Self, so AM I gradually building Humanity so that through It
I can perfectly express My Idea of My Self.

As the individual cells of My Body of Humanity, even as those of your
human body, by partaking of My Life, become Impersonal and harmonious
parts of the organs they form, they live a healthy and happy life. But
let one cell oppose or act contrary to the general law of its organ, and
the harmonious functioning of that organ becomes impossible, which
naturally affects the whole body and results in disease.

Every cell of an organ is an integral part of that organ, and its work
is necessary to that organ's perfect functioning and to the perfect
health of My Body. So that unless each cell gives up all its power and
all its intelligence, which are but attributes of the Life I give it,
toward the perfect functioning of My entire Body, the only result for
My Body can be inharmony, with its consequent effects, disease,
suffering, sin, bondage, poverty, lack of understanding,
disintegration, or death.

Likewise, unless each organ gives up all the intelligence and all the
powers with Which I endowed it, to the one purpose of expressing and
maintaining the life of My Body in perfect health, the only result can
be disorganization, disruption, rebellion, and finally WAR, war
between the various organs and between their respective cells, and a
greater or lesser consequent chaotic condition in My whole Body.

In My Body of Humanity this would mean war between Nations, which are
the Organs of My Body. As all war is but acute disease or disharmony,
and as My Life, which in Humanity manifests as Impersonal Love, can
express only in harmony &ndash; even as in the physical body, It is always
utilizing, equalizing and preparing conditions so that It can thus
express.

This It does either by eradicating gradually from the various organs
of the body all disease, weakened and unfit cells, or by developing
the disease into a malignant form in the physical body. It throws off
such cells quickly by the billions, until a particular organ either is
purified or its power of functioning is wholly destroyed.

In other words, the real life and work of each cell and of each organ
lies in giving up its individual life that My whole Body can Be or
Express in perfect harmony. When each cell and each organ has no other
idea than this, and makes itself a pure and selfless channel through
which My Impersonal Life can flow, then has My Body become a
harmonious and perfect Whole; and then can My Idea express of Earth
Its Divine powers and possibilities, even as it does in the Celestial
Realm of the Eternal.

As you give up your self wholly to Me that I can pour through you My
Holy, Impersonal Love, having no other thought than the perfect
expression of that Love, which is My Real Life, then will I through
you be enabled to quicken and awaken those about you gradually to a
recognition of Me, The Christ within them, so that they too will
likewise give up their selves wholly to Me.

Finally the organ, or that particular part of My Body of Humanity you
and they form, attains perfect health and harmony, and adds its quota
to the bringing about and maintaining of perfect health in My entire
Body.

When such time comes, My Divine Life Force, or My Impersonal Love, will
be flowing and manifesting throughout all Humanity, and My Idea will be
expressing fully on Earth even as It is in Heaven. The Earth and all
Earthly bodies will no longer be of the gross physical material they
formerly seemed, but they will have become utterly purified and cleansed
of the self, and will have been again lifted up to whence they
descended. For the purpose of their creation, that of developing
organisms for the outward manifestation and human expression of My
Divine Idea, will have been accomplished; and having no further use for
physical or outward mediums of such expression, I hereafter will create
and express only with Mind Substance, which is the only medium needed in
the Heavenly World of the Impersonal Life.
