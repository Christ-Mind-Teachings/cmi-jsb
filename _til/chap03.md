title: "I, Life, God"
---

If that which you have read has awakened a response within, and the
Soul of you yearns for more, then you are ready for what follows.

If you still question or rebel at the seeming assumption of Divine
authority for what is herein written, your intellect telling you it is
but another attempt to beguile your mind with cunning suggestion and
subtle sophistry, then you will receive no benefit from these
words; for their meaning is as yet hidden from your mortal
consciousness, and My Word must come to you through other avenues of
expression.

It is well if your personality with its intellect impels you thus to
question and rebel against authority you do not yet know to be Mine. It
is really I Who cause your personality thus to rebel; for your
personality with its proud sense of individuality is still needed by Me
to develop a mind and body strong enough that they can perfectly express
Me. Until you have become prepared to know Me it is but natural for your
personality thus to question and rebel. Once you recognize My Authority,
that moment the undermining of the authority of the personality has
begun. The days of its dominion are numbered, and you will more and more
turn to Me for help and guidance.

Therefore, be not dismayed. Read on, and mayhap the recognition will
come. But know that you can read or not, as you choose; but if you do
it is really I Who choose, and not you.

For you, who seemingly choose not to read further, I have plans, and
in due season you shall learn that whatever you do, or like, or
desire, it is I leading you through all the fallacies and illusions of
the personality, that you may finally awaken to their unreality and
then turn to Me as the one and only Reality. Then these words will
find a response within: 

"Be still! &mdash; and KNOW &mdash; I AM &mdash; God."

Yes, I AM that innermost part of you that sits within, and calmly
waits and watches, knowing neither time nor space; for I AM the
Eternal and fill all space.

I watch and wait for you to be done with your petty human follies and
weaknesses, with your vain longings, ambitions and regrets, knowing that
will come in time; and then you will turn to Me, weary, discouraged,
empty and humble, and ask Me to take the lead, not realizing that I have
been leading you all the time.

Yes, I sit here within, quietly waiting for this; yet while waiting it
was really I Who directed all your ways, Who inspired all your
thoughts and acts, impersonally utilizing and manipulating each so as
eventually to bring you and My other human expressions to a final
conscious recognition of Me.

Yes, I have been within always, deep within your heart. I have been
with you through all, through your joys and heartaches, your
successes and mistakes, through your evil-doing, your shame, your
crimes against your brother and against God, as you thought.

Aye, whether you went straight ahead, or strayed aside, or stepped
backward, it was I Who brought you through.

It was I Who urged you on by the glimpse of Me in the dim distance.

It was I Who lured you by a vision of Me in some bewitching face, or
beautiful body, or intoxicating pleasure, or over-powering ambition.

It was I Who appeared before you within the garb of Sin, or Weakness,
or Greed, or Sophistry, and drove you back into the arms of
Conscience, leaving you to struggle in its shadowy grasp; until you
awakened to its impotence, rose up in disgust, and in the inspiration
of a new vision tore off My mask.

Yes, it is I Who cause you to do all things, and if you can see it, it
is I Who do all things that you do, and all things that your brother
does; for that in you and in him which IS, is I, My Self.
