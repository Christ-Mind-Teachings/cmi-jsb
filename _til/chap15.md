title: "Mediums and Mediators"

You, who, in your desire to serve Me, have joined yourself with a
church, religious organization, occult society, or spiritual order, of
whatsoever nature, thinking, by aiding in and supporting its work, it
would please Me, and that you might receive special favors from Me in
consequence, harken to these My Words and ponder over them.

First, know that I AM already pleased with you, for you do nothing
that I do not cause you to do, and you do it to fulfill My Purpose,
although it may seem to you at times you are acting contrary to My
Wish and only to satisfy your own desires.

Know likewise that I provide all minds with all their experiences of
life, which I utilize solely to prepare the body, quicken the heart
and develop the consciousness, so that they can comprehend Me, and so
that I can express through them My Idea.

I inspire minds with glimpses of Me and My Idea through these
experiences, and I have spoken thus through inspiration to many, who
have taken My Words and have written them in books and have taught them
to other minds. These Words I have caused to quicken the hearts and
consciousness of those who are ready to receive them, even though the
writers and teachers of themselves had no real comprehension of My
Meaning.

Many of those whose minds I thus inspire with glimpses of Me and My
Idea I cause to become teachers and leaders, organizing churches and
societies and cults, drawing seekers and followers to them, that I,
through the words I speak through them, can quicken the hearts and
consciousness of those that are ready to recognize Me.

I, the Impersonal One within, do all this, and the teachers and leaders
personally do nothing, only serving as channels through which My Idea
can express to the consciousness of those I draw to them for that
purpose.

For the mind is only a channel and the intellect an instrument, which I
use Impersonally wherever and whenever necessary to express My Idea.
Not until the heart has been quickened and has opened wide to contain Me
can man, with his mortal mind and intellect, consciously comprehend My
Meaning, when I express through him My Idea.

You, in your desire to serve Me, may have found in some teacher or
leader a personality whom you think, from the many seemingly wondrous
words I speak through him, is now containing Me in his heart.

In your doubts and anxiety to please Me, and in your fear of My
displeasure when disobeying My Commands, you may even have gone to such
teacher or leader, who possibly claimed to be a priest or priestess of
the Most High, thinking to get through such My Message to you, or words
of advice or help from some &ldquo;Master&rdquo; or &ldquo;Guide&rdquo;
you can hold. Until finally, in sorrow and humiliation from the
disillusionment of which eventually and inevitably follows, you once
more are thrown back upon yourself, upon the Teacher within, upon Me,
your own True Self.

Yes, all the deception, all the discipline, all the taking of your ardor
and devotion &ndash; not to speak of your money and services &ndash; to
what you believe to be My Work, and selfishly purloining and utilizing
them for the upbuilding and strengthening of their own personal power
and prestige among their followers; feeding each of you with just enough
subtle flattery and promises of spiritual advancement, together with
clever sophistry under the guise of high and beautiful sounding
spiritual teaching, to keep you bound to them so you would continue to
support and honor and glorify them, ever holding over you the lash of My
displeasure if they receive not unquestioning trust and obedience, yes,
all this I permit to be, for it is what you desire and seek, and Desire
is truly the agent of My Will.

You may be even giving to some other teacher, either in the seen or
the unseen and no matter how true, well-meaning and spiritually wise,
who you think cannot be classed with the kind just mentioned, your
unquestioning love, devotion and obedience, and you may be receiving
what you think are teachings and guidance of inestimable value.

All this is well, so long as you are receiving that which you seek and
think you need; for I supply all things to satisfy such desires. But
know that all such is vain and unproductive of the real results
sought; for all seeking and all desire for spiritual attainment is of
the personality and therefore selfish, and leads only to final
disappointment, disillusionment and humiliation.

If you but can see it, it is in the disillusionment and humiliation
that the real results are attainable, for those are what I opened up
for you and led you towards, when presenting the possibility of
getting help from some human teacher; and these, disillusionment and
humiliation, and what I purposely brought you to, in order that,
having become once more humble and docile as a little child, you would
then be ready to listen to and obey My Word spoken within, and,
hearing and obeying, you could enter into My Kingdom.

Yes, all outward seeking will end thus, and will but bring you back to
Me, weary, naked, starving, willing to listen to My Teaching and to do
anything for even a crust of My Bread, which in your stubbornness and
conceit you disdained before and deemed not good enough for your proud
Spirit.

Now, if you have had enough of teachings and teachers, and are sure
that within you lies the Source of all Wisdom, these words will bring
joy unspeakable to your heart. For do they not confirm that which you
already have felt within to be true?

For you who cannot yet see this and still need a Mediator, I have
provided the story of The Christ crucified for your redemption,
picturing how I desire you to live that, through the crucifixion of your
personality, you may rise in consciousness to Oneness with Me.

But to you who are strong enough to bear it, I say you need no mediator
between you and Me, for we are One already. If you can but know it, you
can come direct and at once to Me in consciousness. I, God within you
will receive you and you shall abide with Me for ever and ever; even as
does My Son Jesus, the Man of Nazareth, through Whom I AM even now
expressing as I did express two thousand years ago, and as I some day
shall express through you.

To you who wonder how and why I say such beautiful and such spiritual
things through personalities who fail to live up to the teachings they
apparently of themselves give out, I say:

I use all avenues Impersonally to express My Meaning.

Some I have prepared to be better mediums of expression than others,
but personally knowing nothing of Me.

In some I have quickened the heart the better to contain Me, thereby
becoming consciously more at One with Me.

Some have become so at One with Me that they no longer are separated
in consciousness from Me, and in Them I live and move and express My
Spiritual Nature.

Since the earliest days of expression on earth I have prepared My
Priests and My Prophets and My Messiahs to vision forth to the world My
Idea &ndash; My Word that shall finally become flesh.

But whether I speak through Priest, Prophet or Messiah, or through a
little child, or through your worst enemy, all words that appeal vitally
to you are the words the I AM of You speaks through the organism of such
medium to your Soul consciousness.

Should a number be gathered together to hear My Word spoken through one
of My Priests, it is not the Priest of himself but I, in the heart of
each hearer, Who draw from the Priest the vital words that sink deep
into the consciousness of each. The Priest knows not what he says that
so affects you, and may not even comprehend My Meaning of the words he
speaks to you.

I within him do draw from the combined devotion to and belief in Me,
consciously and unconsciously expressed by all those gathered around
him, the Spiritual Force which serves as a channel or a connecting line
through or over which I reach the consciousness of those minds I have
prepared to comprehend My Meaning. For although I speak the same words
to all, yet these words contain a distinct and separate message for
each, and no one knows any but the message I speak to him; for I within
you choose from the words the meaning I intend for you, and I within
your brother and your sister likewise choose the meaning I intend for
each of them.

When two or three are gathered together in My Name, there will I always
be; for the Idea which draws them together I, within each, inspire
&ndash; for it is My Idea. From the union of their aspirations towards
Me do I create a medium or channel through which I enable the Soul
consciousness to gain such glimpses of Me as each is capable of
comprehending.

Every Priest, every Teacher, every Medium, I cause instinctively to know
this, for they are My chosen Ministers; and I likewise cause to awaken
in them a desire to surround themselves with followers, that I may
quicken, in the hearts of those who are ready a consciousness of My
Presence within. The Priest, the Teacher, or the Medium, themselves, may
never have recognized Me within, and may be deeming Me as entitized or
personalized in some master or guide or saviour without themselves; but
nevertheless, there are those whom I lead to these, My Ministers, in
whom, through certain words I cause My Ministers to speak, together with
the Spiritual Force furnished by the various aspirants, I am enabled to
awaken their Soul consciousness to a real comprehension of Me, the
Impersonal One, seated within &ndash; in the very midst of All, in the heart
of each.

For the I AM of My Minister, and the I AM of each follower are One, one
in consciousness, one in understanding, one in love, and one in purpose,
which purpose is the fulfillment of My Will.

This I AM, which is wholly Impersonal, and knows neither time, space nor
different identities, merely utilizes the personalities of both Minister
and followers, and the circumstance of personal contact, as a means of
giving voice to My Idea, ever struggling within for outer expression.

Those Ministers who take the confidence and trust of My followers, and
use it to further their own private purposes, I cause to awaken to a
recognition of My Will and My Idea all in proper season. This awakening,
however, is not pleasant to their personalities, and almost always
causes much suffering and humiliation; but their souls rejoice and sing
grateful praises to Me when I bring it to pass.

Therefore, wonder not at the sometimes wonderful words of Truth that
come from mouths apparently unfit to speak them and comprehending not
their meaning; nor at the fact that simple followers oftentimes awaken
faster than and grow beyond their teachers. I Who dwell within both
teacher and follower choose different conditions and provide different
ways for the expression of My Attributes in each different Soul, fitting
each into just the time and place where they can complement and help
each other the best; thus uniting all into the most harmonious
expression of My Idea possible under the circumstances.
