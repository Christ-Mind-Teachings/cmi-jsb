title: "Finding Me"
---

You, who have studied carefully all that has been said herein, and who
think you have gotten a glimpse of Me, but yet are not sure, come
close, and listen with your Soul to what I now have to say.

Be still! &ndash; and KNOW, &ndash; I AM, &ndash; GOD.

If you have learned to &ldquo;Be Still,&rdquo; if you have studied and meditated
upon this &ldquo;I&rdquo; as God within you, if you are able to distinguish It
from the personal I, and are conscious at times of being able to step
outside, as it were, of your personality and view your human self as
it is, see all its petty faults and weaknesses, its base selfishness,
its animal appetites and passions, its childish desires and foolish
pride and vanities;

If you can do all this and have seen these things with clear vision,
know that at those moments you have been One with Me in consciousness,
that it was your Real Self, I within you, permitting you thus to see
with My Eyes the Reality of things.

At those moments you were freed from your personality and were
dwelling in My Consciousness, call it Cosmic, Universal, Spiritual or
Impersonal Consciousness, as you will; for you could not have seen
these things in your self except through Impersonal eyes, My Eyes.

Again, if you will look back you will recall many times when you felt
strongly impelled to do certain things, some of which you did, with
perfect results; others of which you argued against, your intellect
reasoning you into different action, and often with failure,
disappointment or suffering as a result.

This impelling consciousness was only your Real Self, I within you, at
such moments guiding you, distinctly telling you what to do. At those
moments you were hearing with your Spiritual ears, My Ears, and when
you Impersonally obeyed, success and satisfaction followed, but when
you personally thought you knew better, discomfiture, regret and
unhappiness resulted.

Again, there have been moments when you have felt approaching events,
or the nearness of unseen persons, or inharmonious vibrations when
contacting others.

This is only the real You feeling with your Spiritual or Impersonal
Body, whose consciousness, did you but know it, is ever on the alert
to protect and warn and advise you regarding all outer things,
conditions and events.

The best and surest way you may know Me is when Selfless Love fills your
heart, and there is a strong, compelling urge to help some one, to heal
their ills, to relieve their suffering, to bring them happiness, to
point out the True Way, that is the actual feel of Me within you,
pushing the personality aside, using your mind and body for the purpose
I created them, as avenues for the expression of My Real Nature, which
is Perfect Love, the Christ of God, the one, vitalizing, quickening,
life-giving, strengthening, healing, all-supplying, all-informing Power
in the Universe.

All this is pointed out to you in order to impress upon you that it is
I, in your Spiritual body, the Perfect Body within, where I dwell, Who
AM always thus talking to you, advising you, teaching you, warning and
helping you, in all the affairs of life, yes, in every little detail.

If you will but turn to Me, and will carefully watch for and study
these impressions which you are receiving every moment, and will learn
to trust them, and thus to wait upon and rest in Me, putting all your
faith in Me, verily I will guide you in all your ways; I will solve
for you all your problems, make easy all your work, and you will be
led among green pastures, beside the still waters of life.

Ah, My child, if you will spend but one-tenth of the time and energy you
have wasted in seeking without among the husks of human knowledge and
human teachings, in earnest, determined efforts directed within to find
Me;

If you will devote but one hour each day thus to Me alone, imagining and
practicing the Presence of Me within you;

I here promise you that you will not only soon, very soon find Me, but
I will be to you an exhaustless fount of such Wisdom and Strength and
Help, as your human mind now cannot possibly conceive.

Yes, if you will but seek Me thus, making Me FIRST in your life, never
resting until you do find Me, it will not be long before you will become
conscious of My Presence, of My Loving Voice, speaking constantly from
out of the depths of your heart.

You will learn to come to Me in Sweet Communion, and you will find
yourself abiding in My consciousness, and that My Word is abiding in
you, and that whatever you desire will in seemingly miraculous ways be
done unto you.

This abiding continually in Me may be difficult at first, for the
World, the Flesh and the Devil are still presenting evidence to your
consciousness. But you will become accustomed to the use of My
Impersonal Eyes, and will soon be able to see into the Reality of
things, even into the Reality of these seeming Lords of the Earth.
Then you will find you are dwelling in a wondrous new World, peopled
with Angelic Beings, using the Flesh bodies of Their human
personalities merely as vehicles, or instruments, or clothing, in
which to contact the Earthly conditions and experiences They have
created, in order to develop the Soul qualities necessary for the
perfect expression on Earth of My Idea.

To your eyes then there will be no shadows, no evil, and consequently
no Devil; for all is Light and Love, Freedom, Happiness and Peace, and
you will see Me in all, in each Being some attribute of Me, in each
animate thing some phase of Me; and you will need only to let My Love
shine from out your heart and It will illumine for you the Real
meaning of all that you see.

Then the great Realization will come that you have found the Kingdom
of God, that you are walking in It, that It is right here on this
Earth, that It is manifesting all around you, that you have been
living in It all the time, but you did not know it;

That instead of being without in some far off place, It is within your
own being, within every other being, the innermost inner of all
manifested things.

In other words, It will be found to be the REALITY of ALL things, and
that all outward seeming is but the shadow of this Reality, created by
man's misconceptions and his belief in his separateness from Me.

When you have found The Kingdom, you will likewise find your place in
It, realizing now that you are in truth one of My Divine Attributes,
that your work was all laid out for you from the beginning, and that
all that has gone before has been but a preparation and a fitting of
your human personality for that work.

Your whole Soul will leap with joyful anticipation, that, after all
these many years of wandering, you have at last returned to My Home,
and can now enter into My Real Life, One in Consciousness with Me and
with your other Selves, all working to bring about the final perfect
expression on Earth of My Divine Idea.

You, to whom the reading of this has brought memories of previous joys
and whose Soul has quickened in response, do not leave these words until
you have gotten from them all I have to tell you. Be Still! And listen
to My inner Voice, and learn of the glories that await - if you are able
to see with Impersonal Eyes and hear with Impersonal Understanding.

However, if this reading brings to you your first vision of My Reality
within you, setting in motion, by this partial realization of Me and
My Kingdom, high vibrations which lift you into a temporary Spiritual
ecstasy, and you resolve to try to abide always in this Consciousness
of Me, and always to obey Me, -- do not be discouraged should you fail
when immediately thereafter an occasion comes to test the sincerity
and strength of your resolve.

It is only by your trying and failing and realizing keenly your lack
of strength and ability to rest and trust in Me, that I can quicken in
you the consciousness of My Divine Powers ever waiting to manifest
through you.

These high vibrations are only the arousing into action of certain
Soul qualities and their corresponding faculties, which must be
awakened before I can manifest such Powers.

And naturally when such Soul qualities are aroused, they meet active
opposition from certain other qualities which heretofore held
undisputed sway in your nature, and which must be overcome and brought
under subjection and then lifted up into their true service before the
Soul qualities can freely express.

And this opposition should and will strengthen and test and perfect the
expression of these Soul qualities, for you must be capable of
withstanding every attack from without before you can fully manifest all
My Divine Powers pushing forth from within.

Know that I AM manifesting these Powers in you just as fast as you can
bear it and be strong.

The mistake you make is in trying to grow yourself.

I AM the Tree of Life within you. My Life will and must push forth,
but It will do it by gradual and steady growth. You cannot come into
your fruitage before you have grown to it. Remember, My Life is all
the time building you up into the perfection of health and strength
and beauty, that must express outwardly as It is even now expressing
within.

You who have begun to realize I AM within, but have not yet learned to
commune with Me, listen and learn now.

You have learned to "Be Still," and you have perhaps felt My Presence
within. If so, realizing I AM there, ask Me a question. Then , with a
silent, earnest prayer to Me for an answer, but without anxiety, care
or personal interest, and with an open mind, wait confidently for the
impressions that will come.

Should a thought come in answer that you recognize as what you have
heard or read somewhere, cast it out immediately, and say, "No.
Father, what do you say?"

Other thoughts may come from other human sources, but if you are alert
you will recognize them as such and refuse to accept them. Then if you
persist in asking Me, you will finally get an answer that you will feel
is really from Me.

Thus it will be at first. When you have learned to distinguish My
Voice from all other voices, and can keep your personal interest
wholly suppressed, then will you be able to hold silent communion with
Me at will, without interference from others' ideas, beliefs, and
opinions; and you can ask any question you wish, or another can ask
you any question on any problem on which they need help, and I will
that moment place in your mind the words to speak, either silently to
yourself, or audibly through your tongue to the other.

You, My Beloved, who have consecrated your self to Me, and are bending
every effort to find union with Me, but instead have found apparently
that every prop of the World’s support has been withdrawn or is being
withdrawn, and that you are without money and without friends and know
not where to turn for human help;

Learn, My Blessed One, that you are very, very close now, and that if
you will only continue to abide in Me, letting My Word abide in and
guide you, resting and trusting absolutely in My Promise, I will very
soon bring to you a Joy, a Fulfillment, a Peace, that human words and
human minds can not possibly picture.

For you have obeyed My Commands, and you have trusted Me, and have
sought first My Kingdom and My Righteousness, and therefore will I add
all other things unto you, even those the World has denied you.

You, My Dear One, who likewise have consecrated your self to Me, but
who are still holding to some of the World’s standards, being unable
to let go and trust wholly to Me;

You to whom, therefore, I have permitted failure, disappointment, even
poverty, in order to let you learn the false value of all worldly
things, their impermanence, their lack of power to provide happiness,
their having nothing to do with My Real Life;

You, dear child, who do not yet see this and whose heart is full of
anxiety and fear because you do not see where tomorrow's bread is coming
from, or the money for next week's rent, or for the past due mortgage;

Listen once more to My Words long since given to you in the Sermon on
the Mount.

> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall
> eat or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.
>
> Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
>
> Behold the fowls of the air; for they sow not, neither do they reap,
> nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye
> not much better than they?
>
> Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
>
> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the
> field, how they grow; they toil not neither do they spin; and yet I
> say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like
> one of these.
>
> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is
> and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you,
> O ye of little faith?
>
> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? Or What shall we
> drink? Or wherewithal shall we be clothed?
>
> For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
>
> But seek ye first the kingdom of God (being interpreted His
> Consciousness) and His righteousness; and all these things shall be
> added unto you.
>
> Take, therefore, no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take
> thought for the things of itself.
>
> Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

Do you need any more definite Commands or any more definite Promise
than these? You who have consecrated yourself to Me, and call
yourself My disciple. Listen!

Have I not always provided everything? Have you ever been in need but
what I always appeared with help just at the right moment? Has there
ever been a time when things looked dark that I did not bring Light?

Can you, with what you know now, look back over your life and see
where you could have ordered it better? Would you exchange your
Spiritual understanding for the Earthly possessions of any one you
know? Have I not done all this, despite the fact you have been
rebelling and refusing to listen to Me all your life?

Ah, My Children, can you not see that money, home, clothes, food, and
their acquirement are only incidents and have nothing to do with your
real Life, excepting as you make them real by thinking into them so
much importance, and letting Me remain only a side issue?

If it becomes necessary for you to be deprived of the things of the
world that you may learn the Truth, -- that I AM the only important
thing in Life, that I must be FIRST if you truly love Me, I permit
this that real and lasting Happiness and Prosperity can be yours.

This applies to you also, My Child, you who have lost health, have
lost courage, have lost all hold of your Self, and after weary years
of seeking without from Earthly physicians and remedies, following
faithfully every instruction and suggestion given, in order to regain
the Life you have lost, you who have turned finally within to Me,
with the faint hope that I may be able to help you.

Know, My Little One, that you, too, must come in complete surrender to
Me, the One and Only Physician who can heal you. For I AM the Life
Omnipotent within you. I AM your Health, your Strength, your Vitality.
Not until you can feel ME within, and know I AM all this to you, is
real and lasting Health for you to experience.

And now, My Child, draw close. For I AM now going to tell you the
means of obtaining all these things &ndash; Health, Prosperity, Happiness,
Union, Peace.

In the following words lies hidden the Great Secret. Blessed be you
who find it.

Be still! And KNOW, &mdash; I AM, &mdash; GOD.

KNOW I AM in you. KNOW I AM you. KNOW I AM your LIFE. KNOW All Wisdom,
All Love, All Power abides in this Life, which is flowing freely
through your entire being NOW.

I AM the LIFE, I AM the INTELLIGENCE, I AM the POWER in all Substance,
in all the cells of your body; in the cells of all mineral, vegetable
and animal matter; in fire, water and air; in Sun, Moon and Stars. I AM
that in you and in them which IS. Their consciousness is One with
your consciousness, and All is My Consciousness. Through My
Consciousness in them All that they have or are is yours &ndash; for the
asking.

Speak in the Consciousness of your Oneness with Me.

Speak in the Consciousness of My Power in you and of My Intelligence
in them.

Speak &ndash; COMMAND what You WILL in this Consciousness, and the
Universe will rush to obey.

RISE UP! O aspirant for union with Me. Accept now your Divine
Heritage! Open wide your Soul, your mind, your body, and breathe in My
Breath of Life!

KNOW that I AM filling you full to overflowing with My Divine POWER,
that every fibre, every nerve, every cell, every atom of your being is
now consciously ALIVE with Me, alive with My Health, with My Strength,
with Intelligence with My BE-ING!

For I AM within you. We are not separated. We could not possibly be
separated. For I AM You. I AM your REAL Self, your REAL Life and I AM
manifesting My SELF and ALL MY POWERS in you NOW.

AWAKE! Rise up and assert your Sovereignty! KNOW your SELF and your
POWERS! KNOW that all I have is yours, that My Omnipotent LIFE is
flowing through you, that you can take of IT and build with IT what
you WILL, and IT will manifest for you as Health, Power, Prosperity,
Union, Happiness, Peace, anything you WILL of ME.

Imagine this. THINK it. KNOW it! Then, with all the Positiveness of
your nature, Speak the Creative WORD! It will not return to you void.

But know, Beloved, that this cannot be until you have come to Me in
complete and utter surrender, until you have given yourself, your
substance, your affairs, your Life into My keeping, putting all care and
responsibility upon Me, resting and trusting in Me absolutely.

When you have done this, then will the above Words quicken into active
life My Divine Powers latent in your Soul, and you will be conscious
of a Mighty FORCE within you, which, just to the extent that you abide
in Me, and let My Words abide in you, will free you entirely from your
Dream World, will quicken you fully in Spirit, will make all the way
clear for you, supply all things you desire, and lift trouble and
suffering from you forevermore. Then will there be no more doubts and
questionings, for you will KNOW that I, God your very Self, will
always provide, will always point out the way; for You will have found
that You and I are One.
